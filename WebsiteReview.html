<h1>Website Review</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.espn.com/">espn</a></h2>
  <p>The Entertainment and Sports Programming Network is all around a great website. I like this website because of the cleanliness and easy to use access it offers, from a marketing stand point it is very user friendly and appealing to the eye. When you first click on the website it offers up to date scores and has interactive touch. I think the red and black colors blend very nicely, the webiste contains six colums that seem to be rounded. When you scroll down I like that everything is just one feed. I think that overall ESPN could clean there website up a little more by adding more organiziation into the feed of current sports that starts at the top of the page and runs down. Overall, ESPN shows many great attributes in a website from presentation to function the espn website is family friendly and easy to use. If you ever need to a quick sports score or want to know the latest news about your favorite team visit espn.com.    </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.hudl.com">Hudl</a></h3>

  <p>Hudl is a sports platform that is used by many athletes and coaches throughout all sports, Hudl is my second favorite site because of all the tools it offers to athletes from middle school up to the Professional level. Hudl has a feature that allows communication between coaches and players which I think is another very clever attribute to the site, the easy to use message app allows for mass group messages to be sent out. Hudl also offers a film platform for players and coaches to post to for everyone to watch, along with this college coaches can also follow your sports account which makes it practically a social media platform for sports. Another reason I like this app set up so much is because the developer of this app made such a complex app so easy to use with a five colum setup. The main screen of Hudls page allows for easy access to the video feed, and the orange and black is a great all around look for the page.   </p>

  <h4><a href="https://cabelas.com">Cabelas</a></h4>

  <p>For the website I dislike the most I am choosig the oufittter website known as Cabelas. This websiet has many issues, first off by just clicking on it you immediatly see the yucky color green and yellow that make the websites first impressions very uninviting. I also immediatly realised how scattered the website is and I got lost right away. Cabelas website is extremely hard to navigate and has alot going on everywhere, from sales, to coupons, to new realeased gear you just dont know where to begin. The website overall seems to run very slow and lags with your curser. Cabelas website has 20 colums which is far to many in my opinion, they need to consolidate the colums so there arent so many and its not so confusing. The font that cabelas uses is also very undersized which is very uninviting to the eye. The search bar at the top of the webiste is extremely small and is in a poor location. Overall, cabelas needs to redo there entire website to keep up to the modern standard of webistes, the website is extremely uninviting and dry to the eye and needs a refreshment to the color and layout.    </p>
