            <p><img src="Tree.jpg" class="pic"> Seasons are a great aspect to the planet earth and are appreciated by many people, for me personally I would be very disappointed if there were not seasons. Seasons bring a change in enviroment and scenery, along with that is also brings a varity of sports such as football in the autumn, basketball in the winter, and baseball in the spring. Without seasons we truly would not have alot of the things we enjoy to do today.  </p>
